## ETL Project - Yu-Gi-Oh Card Analysis

In this ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project, data extraction of Yu-Gi-Oh cards has been performed using an API. Additionally, the dataset has been enriched by web scraping the information of the top 200 played cards.

Once the data has been collected, it has been cleaned and loaded into a MySQL database for further analysis. The analysis focuses on determining if there is any relationship between the price of the cards and their popularity in the game.
